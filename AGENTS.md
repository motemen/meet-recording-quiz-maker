# Development with Claude

For comprehensive development guidance, see [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md).

## ExecPlans

When writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `.agent/PLANS.md`) from design to implementation.

See the ExecPlans section in CLAUDE.md for details on when and how to use ExecPlans effectively.
